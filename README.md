# ML-Fall2021-Project
This is the end of semester project for the machine learning course i took in the Fall 2021 semester. 


the objective of the project was to take two different data sets and to work on them using three different 
classifiers and 3 different regressiong models. The two data sets were designated and were a credit card 
fraud data set and an energy efficiency data set, which is focused on the energy used to either heat or 
cool different shapes and sizes of apartments/living areas. (links to the two below more on them later)
For the classification models I chose a support vector machine, randomforest, and neural networks ambitiously, 
which due to the fact the assignment was disclosed during the beginning of Nobember, meant I would not have
much time to work on the other regression models given the fact this project existed while i needed to
complete work from other classes. For the regression models I chose to use Linear Regression, Ridge 
Regresion, and Polynomial Regression. The objective was to what knowledge we have accumulated as well as 
pose a challenge as the credit card fraud data set is insanely unbalanced with less than 1% being true 
positive frauds and then the energy efficiency data set is hardly diverse and thus variety very low leading
to a need for data set rebalancing and regularization. Any results found in the span of a month and a half 
of work are printed out as pdf both in raw results and analysis of said results

libraries used:
- numpy
- sklearn
- imblearn
- matplt
- seaborn
- pandas
- keras
