# ML-Fall2021-Project-
This is the end of semester project for the machine learning course i took in the Fall 2021 semester. 


the objective of the project was to take two different data sets and to work on them using three different 
classifiers and 3 different regressiong models. The two data sets were designated and were a credit card 
fraud data set and an energy efficiency data set, which is focused on the energy used to either heat or 
cool different shapes and sizes of apartments/living areas. (links to the two below more on them later)
For the classification models I chose a support vector machine, randomforest, and neural networks ambitiously, 
which due to the fact the assignment was disclosed during the beginning of Nobember, meant I would not have
much time to work on the other regression models given the fact this project existed while i needed to
complete work from other classes. For the regression models I chose to use Linear Regression, Ridge 
Regresion, and Polynomial Regression.
